As per our project this is the STP which we proposed for test of the motor of the High Powered Rocket. All the Results and the testing of the STP is being given in the project report with the file of Autodesk Fusion 360. We have also took care of the surface with our adjustable stands and to get more grip to our HPR motor we have used screw machanism to hold the motor tight as shown in the picture.

As our proposed project this is the avionics bay for the Static Test Pad which we have designed and tested in the Autodesk Fusion 360. File for refernce is also given above. We have seen all the heat and made it accordingly with getting best results. For all the connections and wires we have provided wires from the back side of the bay.

As per our project we have proposed this ejection mechanism for our HPR. In this the parachutte will be released after 3 seconds of it's peak by a sprinf mechanism, resulting our rocket's save landing. We have used servo motor for releasing the spring which will result in opening the nose cone from there our parachutte will come out.
